# SSL Certificates Directory

This directory should contain SSL certificates generated with mkcert for local HTTPS development.

**Do not commit certificate files to version control!**

## Setup

Generate certificates using:

```bash
mkcert -key-file certs/localhost+2-key.pem -cert-file certs/localhost+2.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

This will create:
- `localhost+2-key.pem` - Private key (never commit!)
- `localhost+2.pem` - Certificate

These files are excluded from git via `.gitignore`.
